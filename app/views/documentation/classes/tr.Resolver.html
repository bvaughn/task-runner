<classname name="tr.Resolver" super="tr.Graph" source="https://github.com/bvaughn/task-runner/blob/master/source/tr/resolver.ts"></classname>

<p class="lead">Runs a series of tasks and chooses the highest priority resolution based on their outcome.</p>

<p>
  Once a resolution is chosen, it is added to the graph and run (last) before completion.
  The chosen resolution will will be accessible via the <code>getResolution()</code> method.
  If no resolutions are valid, this task will error.
</p>

<p>
  This type of task can be used to creating branching logic within the flow or a larger sequence of tasks.

<h3>Instance Methods</h3>

<!-- addResolution() -->
<h4 class="page-header">
  addResolution()
</h4>
<p>Add a resolution (a task) and its prerequisite blocking tasks.
Resolutions should be added in the order of highest-to-lowest priority.</p>
  <signature params="[
    {name: 'resolution', type: 'tr.Task', description: 'Task to be chosen if all of the specified blockers succeed.'},
    {name: 'blockers', type: 'Array<tr.Task>', optional: true, description: 'Tasks that are pre-requisites to complete before the resolution can be entered. If this value is undefined or empty, the associated resolution will behave as a fallback if all blockers fail.'}
  ]" return="{type: 'tr.Resolver', description:'A reference to the resolver'}"></signature>

<!-- getChosenResolution() -->
<h4 class="page-header">
  getChosenResolution()
</h4>
<p>Returns the highest priority resolution that was able to be selected based on the outcome of the blocking tasks.
This method should only be called once the resolver has finished running.</p>

<classname name="tr.Resolver" super="tr.Graph" source="https://github.com/bvaughn/task-runner/blob/master/source/tr/resolver.js"></classname>

<p class="lead">Runs a series of tasks and chooses the highest priority resolution based on their outcome.</p>

<p>
  This type of task can be used to implement things like application routers, where one or more dependencies are required.
  It provides an easy way to specify fallback behavior in the event that some of the dependencies fail.
</p>

<p>
  Once the task completes, the chosen resolution will be accessible via the <code>getResolution()</code> method.

  <signature params="[
    {name: 'resolution', type: 'tr.Task', description: 'Task to be chosen if all of the specified blockers succeed.'},
    {name: 'blockers', type: 'Array<tr.Task>', optional: true, description: 'Tasks that are pre-requisites to complete before the resolution can be entered.'}
  ]" return="{type: 'tr.Resolver', description:'A reference to the resolver'}"></signature>

<!-- getChosenResolution() -->
<h4 class="page-header">
  getChosenResolution()

<classname name="tr.Conditional" super="tr.Graph" source="https://github.com/bvaughn/task-runner/blob/master/source/tr/conditional.ts"></classname>

<p class="lead">Provides conditional branching logic based on the outcome of future tasks.</p>

<p>
  This task runs a series of blocking tasks (or preconditions) and then chooses an outcome based on their result.
  Once an outcome is chosen, it is run as well.
  The conditional task completes once the outcome has completed.
  If there are no valid outcomes, this task will error.

<h3>Instance Methods</h3>

<!-- addConditional() -->
<h4 class="page-header">
  addConditional()
</h4>
<p>
  Adds a conditional outcome to the task.
  The outcome's conditions are in the form of <code>tr.Task</code>s.
  If all of the specified conditions succeed, the outcome will be run.
</p>
<p>
  Like an IF/ELSE block, conditions should be added in the order of highest-to-lowest priority.
  Also like an IF/ELSE block, only one outcome is chosen as a result of this task.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-info">
  Note that priority (order) will be ignored if <code>runFirstAvailableResolution</code> is set to true.
</p>
<signature params="[
  {name: 'outcome', type: 'tr.Task', description: 'Task to be chosen if all of the specified conditions succeed.'},
  {name: 'conditions', type: 'Array<tr.Task>', optional: true, description: 'Tasks that are pre-requisites to complete before the condition can be entered. If this value is undefined or empty, the associated condition will behave as a fallback (an ELSE) if all other conditions fail.'}
]" return="{type: 'tr.Conditional', description:'A reference to the conditional'}"></signature>

<!-- getChosenOutcome() -->
<h4 class="page-header">
  getChosenOutcome()
</h4>
<p>
  The outcome that was chosen based on the result of the condition tasks.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-danger">
  This method may return <code>undefined</code> if no outcome has been chosen.
